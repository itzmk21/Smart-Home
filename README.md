# Smart Home

This is a personal smart home app for my Android phone that allows me to control my smart power strip, and smart lights. I worked on this to help me learn Flutter as well as actually using it in my day to day life. It uses the Flutter framework and the Smartthings API, but the Smartthings app itself is too slow to use, which is why I made my own smart home app.
